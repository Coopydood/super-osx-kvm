## Credits

While I am the creator of these automation/ease-of-use scripts, this project is not possible without both the prior and current works of some very talented people. The people who have tested the project are also included.

- **[Dortania](https://github.com/Dortania)** 》 Extensive documentation and Hackintosh development.
- **[Kholia](https://github.com/kholia)** 》 Development of scripts and documentation. ultimate-macOS-KVM is intended as an extension to [OSX-KVM](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM).
- **[thenickdude](https://github.com/thenickdude)** 》 Personal support throughout my KVM misadventures and countless community contribs. Cheers.
- **[vu1tur](to@vu1tur.eu.org)** 》 Open source dmg to img conversion tool; used and bundled by this project.
- **[Eversiege](https://github.com/eversiege)** 》 Support and testing, та мій улюблений українець.
- **[CyberneticSquid](https://github.com/cyberneticsquid)** 》 Testing for me at stupid-o'-clock because he's a cool Aussie.
- **[Cake](https://github.com/cam-jm)** 》 Another Aussie testing for me in the middle of my sleep-deprived nights, with a slight obsession over cake.
- **[Hyperchromiac](https://github.com/hyperchromiac)** 》 My personal constitution-munching American. Legend has it that I live in his attic, although even I'm not sure. Love this guy either way.
- **[Kaz](https://github.com/Eaz11)** 》 Other than his brilliant English accent's pronounciations (including "macOS Syria"), he's done extensive testing. Say hi to your nephew for me.
- **[GigantTech](https://twitter.com/TechGigant)** 》 Moderately annoying German guy that I convinced to install Linux subsequently letting him test my project. It's free real estate!
- **[Hummenix](https://github.com/Hummenix)** 》Testing of ULTMOS across different Linux distros.
