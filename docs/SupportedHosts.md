<h3>Arch Linux<br><sub>Arch Linux Contributors&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM">Open Website... ⎋</a></sub></h3>

This is an advanced distro that is known for its no-nonsense approach to Linux. It does not come with a graphical desktop environment by default, making it a good choice for those who want a minimal system to run KVM on. ULTMOS was developed on this distro, and so compatibility with it is fully guaranteed.

>[!CAUTION] 
> Arch Linux is NOT recommended for new users, but for those already comfortable with Linux. When requesting support or reporting issues on this distro, you will be expected to have a fully working OS install.

<h3>EndeavourOS<br><sub>EndeavourOS Team&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM">Open Website... ⎋</a></sub></h3>

A more user-friendly approach to an Arch-based system. ULTMOS was developed primarily on Arch Linux, so for almost-guaranteed compatibility - an Arch-based distro is recommended.<br><br>

<h3>ZorinOS<br><sub>ZorinOS Team&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM">Open Website... ⎋</a></sub></h3>

This is another very user-friendly distro based on Ubuntu. Similar to Linux Mint, it is aimed at users of Windows by providing a simple but stylish design, that can be customised to look similar to other OSes.

<h3>Ubuntu<br><sub>Canonical&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM">Open Website... ⎋</a></sub></h3>

The most well-known Linux distro, popular for its application support and ease of use. Also forms the base framework for many other distros, such as Linux Mint.

>[!WARNING]
> Ubuntu contains an application distribution method known as "Snap". These "Snap packages" are NOT compatible with ULTMOS, and you will lose technical support when submitting issues or bug reports if you install any dependencies as Snap packages.
